	Volume = {19},

	annotate={
	This paper presents a graph inference retrieval model that aims to improve the effectiveness of search in the medical domain. The authors frame this in the context of the "semantic gap" problem, whereby they investigate the mismatch between raw data, and the way in which human beings actually interpret that data.
	
They go on to propose their novel Graph INference (GIN) model: the corpus is represented as a graph; Information Units, such as terms, concepts and entities are nodes; edges are the relationships between these Information Units (taken directly from structured knowledge resource or derived from corpus statistics). Retrieval is then modelled as a traversal of this graph. They claim that this inference model is able to infer relevant terms that are not usually captured by IR methods such as pseudo-relevance feedback. 

They note that inference has the potential to return large numbers of irrelevant documents; generally as a result of the inference mechanism not utilising structured domain knowledge  applicatible to the specific context of the query. Overcoming this, they express, is in their opinion the greatest challenge of the retrieval as inference approach.

The semantic gap problem is broken down into sub-issues:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Vocabulary Mismatch \\
  Occurs when concepts are expressed in different ways, yet have the same underlying meaning. This can include colloquial and regional variants, as well as abbreviations and acronyms. This is particularly prevalent in the medical domain (\textit{supplies source}). A query may have no overlapping terms with a document, but it could still be highly relevant. We see this concern being realised in the earlier part of our own project.
  \item Granularity Mismatch \\
  Queries often use broad/general terms, whereas a single relevant document may use child concepts. E.g. query may contain \textit{antipsychotic} while relevant document contains instance of this concept: \textit{Diazepam}. "Granularity mismatch is more prevalent in medical IR,
particularly in searching electronic patient records which contain detailed descriptions
and analyses of a patientâ€™s conditions, diagnoses and treatments,
whereas queries express high-level information needs" - provides source. Although this seems like a problem to be solved by the use of ontologies, the authors note that while they may show a connection between the concepts, they often don't express the strength of association between parent and child concepts so it is not clear when it is appropriate to generalise or when to specialise. This inference mechanism needs to include a measure of uncertainty or similarity that is lacking in hierarchical ontologies.
  \item Conceptual Implication \\
  When a document contains evidence in the form of a concept that logically infers the conclusion of another concept. Examples:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{treatment $\rightarrow$ disease}: the presence of a certain treatment implies the existence of a certain disease; e.g chemotherapy $\rightarrow$ cancer. \\
    \item \textit{organism $\rightarrow$ disease}: the presence of certain organisms in laboratory tests imply the disease. \\
  \end{itemize}
  \item Inferences of Similarity
  Where two concepts are semantically similar in some way. An example is disease comorbidities; e.g, \textit{anxiety} and \textit{depression}. These types of relationships and associations are not usually modelled in ontologies designed for deductive reasoning. \\
  \item Context-Specific Semantic Gap Issues \\
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Negation and references to family history \\
    \item Past medical history that may no longer apply \\
    \item Demographic information \\
    \item s \\
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
The paper seems to focus on the first four of these... \\

The model contains a set of Information Units and a set of Information Relationships (directed relationships between the units). Each relationship can belong to one or more relationship types which are taken from ontologies, etc. So a graph consists of the following:
$$G = \langle\mathbb{U,T},T,\mathbb{R}\rangle$$
where $G$ is the graph, $\mathbb{U}$ is the set of information units, $\mathbb{T}$ is the set of relationship types, $T$ is a function that maps relationships to a relationship type, and $\mathbb{R}$ is the set of relationships. A document can then be defined as a sequence of information units.

The authors claim that their method achieves higher accuracy in concept identification than standard weighting methods such as inverse document frequency. One issue discussed regarding verbose queries is that since they likely have numerous key concepts, many search results with inevitably be documents that are relevant to a subset of these key concepts. Additionally, some results may be documents that make reference to more than one concept, however do not match the query in terms of the relation between said concepts. This is said to create the paradoxical situation where less descriptive queries achieve better retrieval effectiveness. \\
	
A ranking principle is used to rank a document in response to a given q
uery by estimating the probability P(q|d). The paper then goes into tec
hnical detail about how to infer this by calculating probabilities of c
oncepts being in the presence of the doc/query etc.

The authors considered noun phrases to be "concepts", which have suppod
ely been proven to be reliable for key concept discovery in existing wo
rk. 

A concept weighting phase is decribed, whereby the probability of a con
cept existing, given a query, to essentially reflect how well a concept
 represents the query at hand. A supervised machine learning approach i
s taken in order to predict which concepts might be the best representa
tions of the query. The authors proceed to go into technical detail reg
arding their approach and the various features used.
\\	
	
A limitation of this method is that it is a strict reduction of the existing term set (does not support novel term inference). Additionally, the authors used topics 12â€“49 terms in length, while our patient reports are 39â€“204 terms in length. The significant differences in verbosity may be an issue.}

Results show that the proposed system achieves similar recall and precision to that of state-of-the-art systems but with significantly improved efficiency (up to 135 times faster than both systems compared against).

The scope of the paper is based around the implementation of a CDS system designed for the retrieval of key medical literature that can assist the practice of healthcare professionals given a medical case report. Mention is made to the fact that  CDS search highly favors precision over recall, since healthcare professionals can only afford to spend limited time reading medical literature while practicing. \\

	The paper explores numerous query reduction and expansion techniques. Reduction techniques include: UMLS concept selection; health-related term selection (powered with wikipedia dump); and Query Quality Predictors (\textit{based on QPP techniques proposed by Kumaran and Carvalho}). The results for the UMLS based reduction were rather poor, which was attributed to the fact that it often discards terms that have a key role connecting domain specific expression (despite it successfully identifying most medical concepts). Their QQP method also performed quite poorly, which was seen to be a result of its aggresive reduction algorithm (reduces report to 6 terms at most). \\

	This paper is highly relevant to our project insofar as it pertains to information retreival where a verbose patient report is used as the query. Although our UMLS reduction proved quite effective, taking note of the concerns expressed in this paper could provide us with some insight from which we can improve our reduction model. Perhaps if we developed some method by which we could retain important terms that connect domain specific expressions we could see enhanced results.

abstract="Providing access to relevant biomedical literature in a clinical setting has the potential to bridge a critical gap in evidence-based medicine. Here, our goal is specifically to provide relevant articles to clinicians to improve their decision-making in diagnosing, treating, and testing patients. To this end, the TREC 2014 Clinical Decision Support Track evaluated a system's ability to retrieve relevant articles in one of three categories (Diagnosis, Treatment, Test) using an idealized form of a patient medical record. Over 100 submissions from over 25 participants were evaluated on 30 topics, resulting in over 37k relevance judgments. In this article, we provide an overview of the task, a survey of the information retrieval methods employed by the participants, an analysis of the results, and a discussion on the future directions for this challenging yet important task.",

annotate = {This survey provides an analysis of the TREC 2014 Clinical Decision Support track and the different approaches taken by its participants. This survey is highly relevant to my research as the task in question involved using the same collection of patient reports as query objects. The analysis of each of the participants' approaches provides me with a collated overview of which query modification techniques were successful. By examing these approaches I can improve my own reduction strategies without performing extensive tests of my own. \\

\textbf{Concept Extraction}: \\
 \\

 \textbf{Negation}: \\
Some particpants utilised negation detection techniques. Variations of these include the pruning of negated concepts, adjusting weight to prefer polarity-matched concepts, as well as replacing negated concepts with an altered representation.  \\
 
  \textbf{Attribute Extraction}: \\
Some participants tried to extract patient attributes that could be deemed clinically important from the reports. Such attributes include a patient's age, gender, and race. Soldaini et al adjusted article scores based on attribute matches, which resulted in their best run. It would be worthwhile to investigate these techniques further as they could form a part of future versions of my reduction model.

annotate= {\textit{This is a placeholder annotation as i am currently unable to find the bibtex.} This paper outlines an investigation into techniques for reformulating medical case reports to be used as queries in the context of clinical decision support search. One interesting feature is the usage of biographical information present in the report, namely: age, sex, and race. The technique used here reranked the list of returned documents from the initial search according to their biographical affinity with the query report. The results of the investigation show that the biographical reranking method outperformed every other method used within the experiment. Looking into how the adoption of a similar biographical reranking method within my query generation model effects results could be a worthwhile task to cary out in the future.}

abstract="The internet is an important source of medical knowledge for everyone, from laypeople to medical professionals. We investigate how these two extremes, in terms of user groups, have distinct needs and exhibit significantly different search behaviour. We make use of query logs in order to study various aspects of these two kinds of users. The logs from America Online, Health on the Net, Turning Research Into Practice and American Roentgen Ray Society (ARRS) GoldMiner were divided into three sets: (1) laypeople, (2) medical professionals (such as physicians or nurses) searching for health content and (3) users not seeking health advice. Several analyses are made focusing on discovering how users search and what they are most interested in. One possible outcome of our analysis is a classifier to infer user expertise, which was built. We show the results and analyse the feature set used to infer expertise. We conclude that medical experts are more persistent, interacting more with the search engine. Also, our study reveals that, conversely to what is stated in much of the literature, the main focus of users, both laypeople and professionals, is on disease rather than symptoms. The results of this article, especially through the classifier built, could be used to detect specific user groups and then adapt search results to the user group.",

Determining if this assessment imposes cognitive load on human assessors, and why this is the case, may shed lights on what are the (cognitive) processes that assessors use for determining document relevance (in this domain). High cognitive load may impair the ability of the user to make accurate relevance judgements and hence the design of IR mechanisms may need to take this into account in order to reduce the load.}
